Fill anything you want to say about your homework.

\textbf{[Important] Reference to work of others.} You can refer to another person's key idea in writing the source code, but in this case you must leave a reference in the writeup. If you take someone else's idea and leave a reference, you will only get 0 points in the "Implementation" part of that problem in the scoring process. 
However, please note that if you do not mention the reference even though you have brought in someone else's idea, you will get 0 points for all the problems in that homework.

\section{Composing Filters [5 points]}

Yes, applying G followed by E is equivalent to applying E and then G, because they are both linear kernels and can be applied by convolution. Convolution is commutative and associative, so the order is irrelevant.
If M is used however, the result will not be the same. M is a median filter, so it is non-linear and thus cannot be applied using convolution. The result will vary depeding if E or M is applied first.

\section{Decomposing a Steerable Filter [10 pts]}

A 2D gaussian filter is symmetrical and thus can be separated into two 1D gaussian filters:
\begin{equation}
    G(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} exp(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2})
    = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}) * \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} * exp(-\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2})
    = G\textsubscript{x}(x) * G\textsubscript{y}(y)
\end{equation}
This separation has a great impact on comutation speed. Applying a 2D filter as is takes \mathcal{O}(n^2) time, while it takes only \mathcal{O}(2*n) time if the filter is separated.

You can enumerate subquestions like this.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Enumerate item 1.
    \item Enumerate item 2.
    \item Enumerate item 3.
\end{enumerate}

You can write your equations by using \verb|\begin{aligned}|.
We highly recommend you to use \verb|\newcommand| to simplify your equation in \LaTeX.

\begin{align}
    \Ab &= 12 \\
    \alpha_{12}^{35} &= 1234 \\
    \beta_1 &= 10
\end{align}

You can cite your reference by using \verb|\cite{reference_name}|.
For example, cite R.Szeliski's Compute Vision book \cite{szeliski2010computer} like this.
